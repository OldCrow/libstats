## Notes

### NUMA Optimization Status
As documented in the comprehensive review, NUMA optimizations have been **deprioritized** for libstats:

- **Rationale**: 95% of target systems (desktop/laptop) have no meaningful NUMA topology
- **Current Focus**: Cache-friendly algorithms, SIMD enhancements, memory pool optimization
- **Future Consideration**: NUMA will only be reconsidered if >10% performance impact is demonstrated on systems with >32 cores and multiple memory controllers

### Completed Items
- ✅ **NUMA Priority Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis completed, documented in Level 2-3 review
- ✅ **Work Stealing Pool Documentation**: Updated to clarify NUMA optimization status
- ✅ **Implementation Roadmap**: This document serves as the comprehensive plan
