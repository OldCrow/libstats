- Leverages existing `math::calculate_ks_statistic` utility
- Thread-safe with proper error handling
- Successfully detects non-normal data

**Anderson-Darling Test**
- Complete implementation with p-value estimation
- Uses `math::calculate_ad_statistic` from math utilities
- More powerful than KS test for detecting deviations from normality
- Handles edge cases and provides robust statistical inference

### ‚úÖ Cross-Validation Methods

**K-Fold Cross-Validation**
- Configurable number of folds (k)

- Provides unbiased estimates of model generalization performance

**Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**
- Exhaustive cross-validation for smaller datasets
- Returns mean absolute error, RMSE, and total log-likelihood
- Computationally intensive but provides the most unbiased error estimate

### ‚úÖ Bootstrap Methods

**Parameter Confidence Intervals**
- Bootstrap resampling with configurable sample size
- Generates confidence intervals for both mean and standard deviation parameters
- Uses percentile method for CI construction
